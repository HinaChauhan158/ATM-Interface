# ATM Interface with Java Swing

This project implements a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using Java Swing. It simulates the functionalities of a real ATM, allowing users to perform common banking operations such as:

- Checking account balance
- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money
- Transferring funds between accounts

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users are required to enter their account credentials (e.g., account number and PIN) to access the ATM functionalities, ensuring security.
  
- **Account Management**: Users can view their account balance, deposit money into their account, withdraw money (if sufficient funds are available), and transfer funds between accounts.

- **GUI Implementation with Java Swing**: The user interface is designed using Java Swing, providing a user-friendly experience with buttons, text fields, and labels.

## Getting Started

To run the ATM interface on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-interface.git


2. **Open in IDE**: Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

3. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run the `ATM.java` file to start the ATM interface.

4. **Enter Credentials**: Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your account credentials and access the ATM functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (GUI Library)
